## My process

### Built with

-   Vite (https://vitejs.dev/)
-   ReactJS (https://react.dev)
-   Sass/Scss (https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I used React because i have not used React in a while and wanted to remind myself of the process of creating components and linking them together.

Also i learned a few little things in CSS / SCSS
like this dynamicly usable custom property for hsl color

```css
--hsl-light-red: 0, 100%, 67%;
--light-red: hsl(var(--hsl-light-red));
```

but also usable as hsla like:

```css
--opacity: 0.05;
background: hsla(var(--hsl-light-red), var(--opacity));
```

### Continued development

Using React for one of the next bigger projects, so i keep working with React and not only use Vue
